# A Program To Mangage Assets Used In My Portfolio

This program was designed with the idea of updating my portfolio via a nosql backend database. It will be designed to connect to Firebase and interact with it remotely. The program allows for the creation and updating of information reguarding projects I've worked on skills I've used and technolgy I've worked with.

## Setup

Populate env varaible 'FIREBASE_API_KEY' with key

## Usage

The VIEW tab allows for the viewing of current information in the database. Here you can reorder and remove entries.

The CREATE tab allows you to create any of the fields currently implemented. Currently planned for Projects, Skills, and Technology.

The UPDATE tab allows you to select an entry and modify it. Currently planning for all but Title/Name to be modified.
